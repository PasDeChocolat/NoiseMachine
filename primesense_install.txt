Something like this, this was just inspiration:
http://blog.nelga.com/setup-microsoft-kinect-on-mac-os-x-10-8-mountain-lion/
http://developkinect.com/resource/mac-os-x/install-openni-nite-and-sensorkinect-mac-os-x

download these things (note, these are the old versions - which you want):
http://www.openni.org/openni-sdk/openni-sdk-history-2/
- OpenNI v1.5.4
- NITE v 1.5.2

download this from here:
https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect
- SensorKinect 1.5.4

after you download and extract these things (above) you have to get rid of the extended attributes (quaratine) flags on files and folders:
-rw-r--r--@
See that @ sign?

Do this with this command:
$ sudo xattr -cr .

If you don't you'll have permission problems after you do the install and you try to run the app.
